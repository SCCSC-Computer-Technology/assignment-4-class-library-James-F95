The code appears syntactically correct and should compile without errors or warnings. The code is very readable. It defines a class StateData with properties representing various information about a state. However, there are no comments or documentation explaining the purpose of the class or its properties. Adding comments to describe the purpose and usage of the class and its members would improve readability and maintainability. Adding comments above the class and each property would help other developers understand the intent of the code. There's no apparent repetitive code, and there's no dead code, and no software defects are apparent either. The code doesn't include any explicit exception handling. It's generally a good practice to handle potential exceptions, such as invalid input values in the constructor. This authors code was similar to mine in that we both used get; set methods for our state info, but they used a constructor while I provided individual methods for searching, sorting, filtering, and updating. Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the class and its properties. This will help other developers (and yourself in the future) understand the code more easily.
